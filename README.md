# BikeSales-Analysis-in-SQL
BIKE SALES ANALYSIS REPORT

This a SQL, Excel, and Tableau project component with all three interrelated and based on the same dataset. We start by pulling the relevant data from the company’s database using SQL to build a well-structured and dynamic dashboard using Excel and Tableau. I created a mock database from the three files (BikeStores Sample Database - create objects, BikeStores Sample Database - drop all objects and BikeStores Sample Database - load data) and assumed this was the original database I was referred to by the client. I created a spreadsheet that I would later use for visualization out of this database by firing some SQL scripts that would give me the resulting table to help me do this effectively. Next, I import the SQL generated dataset into Excel then use pivot tables to generate a dynamic dashboard in Excel. The very same Excel sheet that contains the SQL-generated dataset is connected to Tableau and used to generate a dynamic dashboard for management.
The steps followed in this project were as follows:

•	Understand the problem by defining the project goals and laying out the plan to find the best solution.

•	Collect and gather data from various sources based on set priorities.

•	Clean the data to remove redundant information than may impede analysis.

•	Gather and analyze the data.

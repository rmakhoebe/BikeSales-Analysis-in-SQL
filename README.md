# BikeSales-Analysis-in-SQL
BIKE SALES ANALYSIS REPORT
This a SQL, Excel, and Tableau project component with all three interrelated and based on the same dataset. We start by pulling the relevant data from the company’s database using SQL to build a well-structured and dynamic dashboard using Excel and Tableau. First tap into the company’s relation database by writing an SQL script to generate a detailed dataset that provides me with the data and information I need to put together a comprehensive and dynamic dashboard for the Executive team at the company. Next, I import the SQL generated dataset into Excel then use pivot tables to generate a dynamic dashboard in Excel. The very same Excel sheet that contains the SQL-generated dataset is connected to Tableau and used to generate a dynamic dashboard for management.

•	Understand the problem by defining the project goals and laying out the plan to find the best solution.
